# Stock-Market-Analysis
My goal is to use a Fixed Effects model to compare the predictive power between the growth rate in the volume of stocks traded and a stock's daily risk. I judge how well these variables can predict the stock market's daily returns.  I use daily stock market data from the previous six years.

I find that daily risk in stock prices and the daily growth rate in the volume of stocks traded are poor predictors of a stock's daily returns.
